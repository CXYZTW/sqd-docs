## What is the SQD Portal?[​](#what-is-the-sqd-portal "Direct link to What is the SQD Portal?")

The SQD Portal is a decentralized, streaming-based data retrieval solution designed to replace our centralized gateways. It provides faster, more reliable, and flexible access to blockchain data.

SQD Portal can supply both historical and real-time data seamlessly, eliminating the need for an RPC endpoint. Real-time capability is currently only available for Solana, with plans to add it for all EVM and Substate networks soon.

#### Key Features[​](#key-features "Direct link to Key Features")

* **Fully Decentralized**: Powered by 1,900+ independent worker nodes.

* **High Replication**: Redundant data storage for maximum reliability, capable of querying up to **20 million blocks per second**.

* **Improved Performance**: A new Rust-based query engine now leverages parallelized queries and incorporates numerous query execution performance optimizations, delivering an overall **10-50x performance boost** compared to the centralized gateways.
  * Note: This performance improvement is specific to data retrieval. If your application faces other bottlenecks (like database limitations), you may experience a more moderate gain in indexing speed.

* **Real-time Capability**: Portal is now capable of streaming real-time data, including unfinalized blocks.

  * *Currently only available on Solana*
  * Coming soon for EVM and Substrate networks

## What You Can Do[​](#what-you-can-do "Direct link to What You Can Do")

### 1. Explore Soldexer — Our New Brand for Solana[​](#1-explore-soldexer--our-new-brand-for-solana "Direct link to 1. Explore Soldexer — Our New Brand for Solana")

If you’re working with Solana, visit [soldexer.dev](https://soldexer.dev) to check out our new client architecture, powered by the updated Portal API.

### 2. Migrate to the Cloud Portal[​](#2-migrate-to-the-cloud-portal "Direct link to 2. Migrate to the Cloud Portal")

Cloud users can now switch from centralized gateways to our dedicated Cloud Portal and benefit from enhanced performance and the latest features of our new query engine.

* **Migration guides**:

  * [For EVM and Substate users](/cloud/resources/migrate-to-portal-on-evm-or-substrate/)
  * [For Solana users](/cloud/resources/migrate-to-portal-on-solana/)

### 3. Set Up a Self-Hosted Portal[​](#3-set-up-a-self-hosted-portal "Direct link to 3. Set Up a Self-Hosted Portal")

* Take complete control of your data infrastructure by running your own Portal.

* **Setup Guide**: [Self-Hosting Instructions](/subsquid-network/participate/portal/)

* **Requirements**

  * Minimum 10,000 SQD tokens.
  * A working Docker installation.
  * Some Arbitrum ETH for gas.

### 4. Explore the Public Portal[​](#4-explore-the-public-portal "Direct link to 4. Explore the Public Portal")

Public Portal allows access to nearly all the datasets that were available from the centralized gateways. Use it for development and tests.

Browse EVM datasets at [portal-ui.sqd.dev](https://portal-ui.sqd.dev/). Solana [(and compatible SVM networks)](/subsquid-network/reference/networks/#solana-and-compatibles) and Substrate datasets will be available soon.
