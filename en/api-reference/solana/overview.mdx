## Quick Start

```bash
# Get Solana dataset metadata
curl https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/solana-mainnet/metadata

# Stream recent blocks with Drift protocol instructions
curl -X POST https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/solana-mainnet/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fromBlock": 317617480,
    "toBlock": 317617482,
    "instructions": [{
      "programId": ["dRiftyHA39MWEi3m9aunc5MzRF1JYuBsbn6VPcn33UH"]
    }]
  }'
```

## Rate Limits

<Warning>
