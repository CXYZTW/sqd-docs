# EVM API Reference

The EVM API provides access to Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchain data through the SQD Network Portal. This API is optimized for querying transactions, logs, traces, and state changes across all supported EVM networks.

## Key Features

## Supported Networks

The EVM API supports 100+ networks including:

- **Ethereum Mainnet & Testnets** (Sepolia, Holesky)
- **Layer 2s** (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon)
- **Alternative EVMs** (Avalanche, BSC, Fantom)
- **Emerging Networks** (Blast, Scroll, zkSync Era)

See the complete list in [Supported Networks](/en/supported-networks).

## Data Types

### Blocks
Block headers with metadata like timestamp, gas usage, and miner information.

### Transactions  
Complete transaction data including inputs, outputs, gas usage, and execution status.

### Logs
Event logs emitted by smart contracts with topics and data.

### Traces
Detailed execution traces showing internal calls, contract creation, and value transfers.

### State Diffs
Storage slot changes and account balance modifications.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get latest block metadata
curl https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/ethereum-mainnet/metadata

# Stream recent blocks
curl -X POST https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/ethereum-mainnet/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fromBlock": 19000000, "toBlock": 19000002}'
```

## Rate Limits

<Warning>
  All endpoints are rate limited at **50 requests per 10 seconds per IP**. Higher bandwidth will be available via the public network.
</Warning>
