<Info>
  Starting today (2025-02-23) all open private network gateways are rate limited
  at 50 requests per 10 seconds per IP. Higher bandwidths will soon become
  available via the public network.
</Info>

SQD's [open private network](/en/subsquid-network/overview/#open-private-network) serves Fuel Network data via the following gateways:

|   Network    |                     Gateway URL                     |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| Fuel Mainnet | https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet |
| Fuel Testnet | https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-testnet |

Gateway URL should be used with the [`setGateway()`](/en/fuel-indexing/fuel-datasource/general/#set-gateway) `FuelDataSource` configuration method:

```typescript
const dataSource = new FuelDataSource().setGateway(
  "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet"
);
```

See [Fuel API](/en/fuel-indexing/network-api/fuel-api) if you're looking to interface with any of the Fuel gateways directly.
